# String Expression Calculator

## Description

A small project — a calculator that processes mathematical expressions given as text strings.  
The core focus is on a custom-built algorithm for parsing and evaluating expressions, without relying on standard parsers or notations like postfix.

Evaluation is based on recursive analysis of the expression's structure, with full support for operator precedence and nested parentheses.  
The project includes unit tests that cover key scenarios, including complex and invalid expressions.

> Created as part of a coursework assignment. Demonstrates the ability to build algorithms, structure code, and write test coverage.
